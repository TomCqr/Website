### About my project

My project was on the Double Bacon Cheese Burger from Burger King. I chose this product because I enjoy burgers and though it would make a good website.

My home page includes a hero image of the burger and some text about it.
The images page has 6 images of burgers and Meals from Burger King. 
I included a video to show the product in more detail and to make people hungry / interested in the product. 
The contact page includes contact information, such as email and phone number for Burger King

 ### My Design Process
 
* Layout:
  * CSS Grid with option for multiple areas for image and text content 
  * I put the Nav at the top of the page and keept it consistent throughout the website 
* Colour:
  * The colour on my pages are taken from the media, images and video 
  * I chose colours that compliment the images and make them stand out 
* Font/s:
  * I chose these fonts because they fit well with the product and are easy to read
* Navigation (Site Map)
  * I used CSS grid, because it was easy to code and arrange the media how I wanted i 
  * The nav is consitent througout the pages to make it easier to navigate
  * The translate button is at the bottom of the page so it can be found easily
